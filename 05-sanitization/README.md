# Class 5: Sanitizing Input

At any point where input is used in code you must clean
it up to prevent input from become an exploit. 

## Objectives 

- Review and identify HTML entities, URL Encoding, and CSS Escapes
- Identify where sanitization should be applied
- Differentiate front end and backend sanitization
- Apply anitization for front end and back end with JavaScript
- Implement JavaScript bundling for front end

## What is sanitization? 

Cleaning up input so that it can not be executed as code. 
Any plain text that is part of the the content for page 
that is code will be treated as code! 

To prevent malicious scripts from running in your pages
all input needs to be sanitized. This process converts 
all special characters to HTML entities or removes dangerous 
elements like `<script>`.

\' OR 1 = 1;

## HTML entities 

HTML entities are character sequences that represent special 
characters.

## CSS Escapes

## URL Encoding

## Client side vs Server side

Some of the code you write only runs on the server. 
These are things like getting and putting information 
into the database. 

Other code runs in the browser or client computer. This is 
usually code that handles user interaction and manages content 
from the browser. 

Depending on where you are using user input you will want to 
sanitize from one side or the other, probably both. 

## Bundling JS with Browserify

When working with Node and Express you are managing dependancies 
on the server side. These files are *not* accessible in the browser. 

You can use [Browserify](http://browserify.org) to bundle 
JavaScript files into a single file that can be used by the 
client browser. This allows you to leverage NPM libraries on 
the Client. 

You'll use Browserify to collect JavaScript libraries into a 
single file that you can link to from the client. 

Follow= the instructions here: http://browserify.org

### IIFE

Immediately Invoked Function Expression. This is the key to 
managing large amounts of JavaScript code. 

- Isolates variables and functions from the global name space. 
- Makes code portable

### Serving static files

Express only serves files from routes. To serve static files
you will need to designate a static folder. 

```JS
// Serve static resources from the public folder
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

## Sanitizing Clientside 

Write your own sanitization script

```JS
function encodeHTML(s) {
    return s.replace(/&/g, '&amp;').replace(/</g, '&lt;').replace(/"/g, '&quot;');
}
```

Or, use a library:

## Sanitizing server side

Use a library like DOMPurify or write your own sanitization script
but, if you're working with Express JS you have access to 
middleware.

## Challenges


- Write a sanitization script for the client
  - Choose one: 
    - Write a string parser that replaces <, >, and & with HTML entities. 
    - Use Browserify to install DOMPurify. 
      - Follow the instructions to install Browserify
      - Define a Public static folder in Express
      - Install DOMPurify
        - You will have to run all of your client JS from a module!

- Add a sanitizer to Express. 
  - Feel free to use any approach, realize that in this case 
  it's probably best to use middleware as this is the best workflow 
  with express. 
    - Try this middleware:
