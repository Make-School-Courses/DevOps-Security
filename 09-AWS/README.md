# AWS

AWS is really popular. It's really big. It's like the Borg of cloud computing. 

## Cloud Computing

A bunch of computers connected to the internet. Besides computer storage, 
AWS offers Frameworks and tools to run complex systems. This includes
analytics, security, databases, developer tools, and more. 

**High Availability** cloud computing makes storage available anywhere 
on any device. 

**Fault Tolerant** provides the ability to get a copy of a file that may
become corrupted at one point. 

## Well Architected Framework

Using AWS you get a top quality framework maintained by pros. 

## AWS Associate Certificate

You can get your own AWS certificate!

## Data Center 

Amazon maintains the computers so you don't have to. 

- No need to maintain
- No need to store and power
- No need to expand 
- No need to employ an expert

## Virtual machines 

Allow for adding or removing machines at any time with no cost for 
installation and maintainence instantly.  

**Scalability/Elasticity** grow or shrink on demand as needed. 

## Regions and Availability Zones 

Amazon maintains data centers in regions. You can create machine 
instances in regions to decrease latency. 

- Regions 
  - A geographic Area
  - 15 Regions exist plus Gov Cloud 
  - They are dynamic and change over time
  - Some Regions may not provide some services

## IAM 

Defines the Authentication and roles for users

- Usernames passwords and permissions
- Multi Factor Authentication
- Identity Federation 
- Temporary access

- Users Groups define Who can access people or objects 
- Roles Define Where they can access EC2, S3 buckets etc.
- What can they do?

### Identities (Users, Groups, and Roles)

Allow IAM users to connect to your AWS services. 

IAM Users - represents a person or service who interacts with AWS. 
Grant a user permissions by making it a member of a group that has 
permission policies attached to it. 
Primary useages:

- Management console
- Make Programatic requests

IAM Groups - Use groups to specify permissions for collections of users.
Any user assigned to the group has permissions assigned to the group. 
Use groups to: 

- Easily manage permissions for users

IAM Roles - have an identity with permissions, like users, unlike users 
roles don't have credentials (password, access keys.) A user can take 
on a role temporarily to assume permission for a specific task. 

Root user - Has complete unrestricted access to all resources on your 
AWS account including billing and the ability to change your password!

While this level of access is necessary when you first create your 
account, you don't need this level of access for day to day operations.

### IAM - Setup an admin user

These steps walk through creating an admin account with user roles 
and groups. 

Note: By default you are logging in with root permissions. Best practice 
is to delete or not generate your root access keys.
