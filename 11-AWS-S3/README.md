# S3

## Working with S3

S3 (Simple Storage Service) is designed for large capacity low 
cost storage across multiple geographical regions.

What can you store on S3? Anything, images, text, audio, video, 
or other media. 

S3 stores data in the form of Objects. An object consists of:

- data
- key
- metadata

S3 has three classes of storage. 

- Standard Access - Suitable for performance with low latency. 
- Standard Infrequent Access - Suitable for long lived in frequently accessed files. 
- Glacier - Suitable for archiving data. 

Besides performance the cost associated is different for each sservice, 
Glacier is the cheapest. 

S3 is organized in buckets. A bucket is the standard unit. A bucket 
contains an Object with it's data and metadata. 

S3 stores data in geographical regions. Storing data in a region 
that is closer to your customers increases performance. The 
services offered and costs vary with region. 

S3 allows data to be replicated across regions. 

### Why use S3?

Use S3 when you need a scalable storage solution for digital files. 

### Objectives 

- Make buckets
- Upload files
- Set permission on buckets
- Enable versioning

## S3 Buckets

### Create an S3 Bucket

Log into the AWS Console. (You may need to verify your account!)

Under Storage, Click on S3

Click on Create Bucket

Name your bucket. (You'll need a name that is unique across all of S3)
You can use your name and the date, or your web domain. Domain names 
are unique. 

Click Next

At the Properties screen, do not change any of the default settings.

Click Next

Under Manage Public Permissions choose Grant Public Access to this Bucket.
This makes the content of this bucket available publicly to the world. 

Click Next

Click on Create Bucket

Click on the bucket you just created

Review the Properties, Permissions, and Management

Click on Amazon S3, then click your bucket name. 

Click on Upload at the top left – Be aware that there are limitations with the 
free tier. https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/pricing/s3/
Adding data beyond the scope of this lab may result in charges.

Click on the Add Files

Click Next

Under Manage Public Permissions, Choose Grant Public Read Access to these Objects

Click Next

Do not change the storage class or encryption settings.

Click Next

Click Upload

Right-click the file and choose Open in New Window. 
Does it open? – You set permission when you uploaded the file, so it is accessible.

Return to the AWS Console (Close the new browser window that just opened) – 
You should still be in your bucket, and the image file should be selected.

Move the image file to the Infrequent Access storage class and Encrypt it.
Infrequent access is billed at a lower rate and is slower to access. 

Click on the Properties tab

Under Storage Class, click on Standard

Select Standard-IA, and click Save

Click on Encryption

Click on AES-256, and click Save

The file is now encrypted on the server. You might use this as part of a
