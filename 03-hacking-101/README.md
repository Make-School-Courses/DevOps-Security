# Class 3: Hacking 101

A good way to study concepts is by working with a functioning system. 
You will use the demo app in this way. The app is small in scale 
and not very complex. You should all be familiar with it's features
from other apps you have created in class previously. 

The app uses express and makes use of the new JavaScript Async Await
syntax. This is an alternative to the .then().catch() syntax. Async
and Await work with Promises as you will see, and both systems are
realted and compatible.
